<hr>
    <p>When I lived in Italy, every time I went to buy shoes, I ended up arguing with the shopkeeper. Now that I live in Finland, my size 47 is no longer a problem. In Italy, on the other hand, whenever I asked for a size 47 shoe, the shopkeeper would start by blaming the factories that only produce up to 45, then say that yes, a few would arrive every now and then, but they'd sell out quickly, contradicting himself shortly thereafter by saying he can't order so many because otherwise they'd occupy space in the shop, and finally admit that he didn't order them because selling a 47 shoe took him more time and effort than selling a 39. In the end, he would inevitably end up saying that he knows his trade, and that he did what he did to earn money, certainly not to do me a favor.</p>
    <p>The reason that gentleman sold shoes wasn't to make people walk, to offer protection for their feet, or to provide a service to society. The reason was solely and exclusively to make money. What should be merely a byproduct of the work done becomes the "purpose" of the work itself.</p>
    <p>I don't want to sit here and debate the morality of a culture that places money, and especially enrichment, as the primary goal of everything, but only its consequences in general and particularly in the field in which I carry out my professional activity: information technology, or rather, the processing of information through data processors.</p>
    <p>I believe, in fact, that this particular attitude leads us to see life through a colored filter that changes interpretations and encourages to misinterpret. Thus, we are led to consider a businessman who manages to sell freezers to the Inuit (formerly called Eskimos) a good man, without caring that, by doing so, he deprives them of the money they need to purchase useful things, by instead giving them something useless in exchange. Thus, we are driven to applaud the successful executive who takes his company to the pinnacle of global finance, regardless of whether, to achieve this success, he deceived his customers, robbed his competitors, and impoverished the entire society by filling the market with objects that do not meet current technology.</p>
    <p>When you walk into a computer store and get told the fantastic virtues of the latest most expensive model, when you hear that, of course, the computer is already pre-installed with the latest version of the best and only software, ask yourself whether you're being sold a shoe that's too small or too big, and allow yourself to be disturbed by the doubt that the technological expertise of a salesman dedicated solely and exclusively to making money might be misled, if not counterfeit.</p>
    <p>Yes, because in reality, the much-glorified technological marvel of certain successful products is nothing more than pure appearance artfully passed off as technology, a pure marketing plot, and not even a very sophisticated one, to trick you into believing you're benefiting from so much expertise. You should even be grateful for having brought to your desk a computer that, for just 5000 CHF, sits idle waiting for the printer to finish printing (don't be surprised: all the other computers equipped with a different program than the one they sold you are capable of working even while the printer prints, and have been doing so for over twenty years!). I'm sorry, but you've been scammed.</p>
    <p>Or like when convoluted press campaigns lead you to believe that viruses capable of attacking and ruining your computer might actually exist.</p>
    <p>Viruses are nothing more than simple, sometimes banal, programs that exploit errors and malfunctions in the program you use on your computer, causing it to perform more or less harmful actions, certainly unwanted by you. You were defrauded because, instead of correcting the errors, the ingenious monopolists of global IT flooded the market with expensive palliative remedies against viruses, which in reality only eliminate them after you have been infected, and do nothing to prevent them from infecting you. Nine years ago (1989), a malicious program, later dubbed the Internet worm , managed to block, for a few hours, most of the computers then connected to the Internet. Experts studied the problem and tried to identify what changes needed to be made to their programs to prevent the problem from recurring. And indeed, the problem has not recurred, and those same experts are constantly vigilant to identify possible attack points and modify their systems before anyone can actually carry out an attack. But this was not the path followed by the genius of computer commerce, who masterfully managed to create a multi-billion dollar market based on antivirus software. Some malicious people even went so far as to believe that, after the disappearance of the Eastern villains, once labeled computer plague spreaders, the only ones profiting from the existence of viruses were the antivirus vendors , going so far as to suspect (how shameless!) that the manufacturers of both... were the same.</p>
    <p>I'm sorry, but you've been defrauded. You've been led to believe that the numerous limitations of the best and most advanced software were technological limitations, and, conversely, that any improvement, however late, is a wonderful invention of our businessmen, to whom we owe all our admiration and gratitude. You've been defrauded. Amen.</p>
    <p>And what are we to think when even the untrustworthy and guilty behavior of our businessmen is taken up and announced to the world as worthy, by those who instead should, by culture and experience, be able to perceive the true meaning of certain operations?</p>
    <p>I am referring to the hagiographical manner in which certain media outlets have portrayed as a generously disinterested gift the financing given to a struggling company by its global competitor, a giant, without considering that the disappearance of the last competitor in the world would represent for the monopolist the disappearance of the last obstacle to the fall of the antitrust axe, which would rightly punish with extreme severity the conquest of a global monopoly by a single company.</p>
    <p>This isn't political fantasy: it actually happened in the late 1970s, when a US antitrust judge pulverized the global telecommunications giant AT&T, forcing it to split into many smaller, competing companies. Despite the resulting increase in employment and total revenue, this didn't make shareholders happy in the slightest.</p>
    <p>I remember how, in those same years, Giorgio Gaber sang a song in theaters whose line went something like, "I've never seen anyone throw something out there and walk away," meaning that no one has ever given their contribution without expecting something in return. And this is even more true in the case of the gift mentioned above.</p>
    <p>But I don't feel like saying there's really no one capable of contributing without necessarily expecting something in return. I don't feel like it because this person exists, and in fact, he's not alone, but surrounded by an invisible crowd of imitators, of which I try to be part.</p>
    <p>In this regard, let me tell you this strange story: six years ago, in 1991, a very young Finnish engineering student, unable to afford an expensive computer, but only a normal PC, wanted to prove, first of all to himself, that he, like anyone else, was capable of creating the ultimate program : the basic program that makes the computer work , a skill that is still recognized only by the greatest programmer , the owner and inventor of the global computer empire.</p>
    <p>A bit presumptuous, don't you think?</p>
    <p>I don't think he had the strength, but, by a strange twist of fate, he had the opportunity: he asked, addressing the audience of all the programmers in the world, recently interconnected in the newborn global network Internet, if there was anyone willing to help him, just like that, without compensation, just for fun: just for a challenge against themselves.</p>
    <p>It hadn't even occurred to him that anyone might accept his offer/request. He hadn't realized he was speaking to a crowd of technicians frustrated by the constant daily compromise in which their technical skills must succumb daily to the deceptive demands of commerce. He didn't understand that he was titillating the deep egos of those who feel they can give so much and are forced to castrate themselves to avoid compromising the market. And he had certainly underestimated the number of people who might actually read his ad.</p>
    <p>Slowly, a few at a time, ten, twenty highly specialized and underutilized technicians took up his challenge because it allowed them to prove their true worth to themselves, but also to their friends and colleagues, and, why not, to the entire world . And then another ten, another twenty, an avalanche. This shy, small, blond boy saw an avalanche of disinterested offers of help arriving on his cheap computer, in his little room in the center of Helsinki. A hundred, two hundred, until he lost count.</p>
    <p>The young man devoted all his time to coordinating this immense group of technicians eager to share with him, who offered nothing in return, the skills and experience their employers scornfully undervalued or even rejected outright. Other work organized itself. Contributions poured in from everywhere at such a pace it was hard to even keep track.</p>
    <p>And the miracle took shape, and it took the form of an operating system, the program without which a computer would be as useless as a switched-off television. Up and running in just six months: something no software engineering professor would ever have considered possible.</p>
    <p>But the machine, once set in motion, didn't stop there: contributions continued in abundance, and new forces kept joining, replacing those who had quit. Month after month, year after year, in a whirlwind that resulted in a new version being released every week, the entire system progressed, evolving until it became the program used today by approximately eight million computers, second only to the emperor of the computer, the ruler of the desktop.</p>
    <p>"How clever," you'll say, "I wonder how much money he made!" "Nothing," is the answer. Yes, because, you see, the condition for obtaining all that selfless help was that no one would profit from it, no one would take possession of it, and that everything built with everyone's help would forever remain the property of everyone, no one excluded, regardless of the amount of work done, even regardless of whether or not you contributed at all. Yes, you understood correctly: even if the names of the authors remain unforgettably engraved, commercial ownership of the thing is granted to everyone, even to you who are hearing about it now for the first time.</p>
    <p>And so, by turning down commercial success, by not pursuing wealth, but precisely by turning it down, he managed to attract around himself the strength and selfless abilities of his colleagues from all over the world.</p>
    <p>Linus Benedict Torvalds is his name, and Linux is the name others chose for his creation. What's it for? It's there to run your computer without making anyone rich, and without requiring you to bleed yourself dry by buying the latest model, because it was designed to run even on older computers from a few years ago.</p>
    <p>How much does it cost? Nothing, per se. You can copy it from the Internet, and then you'll only pay for the time you're connected (a lot, considering the exorbitant telecom rates), or you can buy CD-ROMs, and then you'll pay for the cost of the discs, 10-25 CHF. But the beauty is that, since you have the legal rights to it like everyone else, you can copy it from a friend instead of buying it, you can borrow the CDs and use them to install it on as many computers as you like, you can even duplicate it in a thousand copies and sell them, without having to pay royalties or licenses to anyone, without medieval taxes or duties.</p>
    <p>Of course, let's not make a saint of him now; others before him had theorized and explained why the restrictions imposed on software commerce were merely anti-competitive protection, aimed at improving corporate profits, without any protection for the creativity of the software creators. Others before him had concretely demonstrated that it was possible to create software that could be freely used by everyone, without restrictions, and it was precisely the product of these efforts that formed the foundation upon which Linus and his collaborators built.</p>
    <p>The Internet was just taking its first steps, that great global melting pot now in the news, a terrain conquered by hordes of devotees of the ephemeral and the seemingly meaningless. Linus's great fortune was to be present at that moment, to place his request on the vehicle preferred by the vast majority of IT technicians around the world. Precisely because they were present, they responded en masse, starting an avalanche that is now truly unstoppable.</p>
    <p>But Linus did add something of his own, something important, that little bit of yeast without which the thing would never have begun its meteoric growth: the decision to adopt a license for the program that prohibited imposing any restrictions whatsoever on the usability and further distribution of the product (and which, to me, personally, seems like the "It is forbidden to forbid" from May '68, finally come true). As did the managerial, yet essentially innovative, choice to allow his collaborators full and absolute freedom of action, while retaining control of the flow of contributions and the final packaging of the product.</p>
    <p>A choice that would certainly have horrified his teachers, who from their classrooms propagate the credo of commercial logic and hierarchical organization. If not now, then certainly in the future, they will find themselves having to teach this new way of organizing software production, perhaps not invented, but certainly demonstrated in practice by the student who, as always in these cases, surpassed the masters before they even realized it.</p>
    <p>Well, now you know the world isn't hurtling toward an abyss where everything is commodified and the only quality that matters is the color of money. Instead, there still exists an army of individuals who can respond to the dullness of working life by placing all of their best qualities and abilities — maybe not hidden, but certainly underestimated and underused — at the service of the community. Now you know that even in this world, which appears cold, based on numbers and frozen by the supposedly unnatural relationship between humans and machines, even in this world you thought so distant and inanimate, the bright flower of spontaneous and selfless collaboration has grown, and the tree of collective purpose aimed at the common good has taken root, regardless of gender, religion, language, or... shoe size.</p>
